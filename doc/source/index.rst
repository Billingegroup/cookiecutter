Welcome to Billinge Group's Python cookiecutter documentation!

Statement of need
-----------------

Your research impact can be amplified by distributing your contributions through well-documented software packages. However, creating these packages requires time dedicated to software infrastructure and ongoing maintenance. ``scikit-package`` is a Python package standard and generator that helps you launch new scientific code or migrate existing ones.

``scikit-package`` provides research-quality documents suitable for open-source development and supports Python versions compatible with the `SPEC0 <https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0000/>`_ proposal through automated workflows. Additionally, it offers a streamlined process for building and distributing your scientific software, ensuring reproducibility across all major operating systems. With ``scikit-package``, you can focus on developing your scientific code while ensuring it reaches a broader audience.

What are the useful features?
-----------------------------

To help increase your research impact, ``scikit-package`` offers the following features:

- Automated `PEP8 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/>`_ and `PEP256 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0256/>`_ standard checks.
- Automated PyPI/GitHub release, testing, documentation, and CHANGELOG updates.
- Streamlined package release workflow with a checklist.
- Latest Python version support compatible with `SPEC0 <https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0000/>`_.
- Rich README template containing badges, installation, support, and contribution guide.
- Automatic spelling check, linting for .json, .yml, and .md files.

For more technical details, it includes:

- Pull requests with coverage reports using ``Codecov`` and checks with ``pre-commit CI``.
- Namespace package support, e.g., ``import diffpy.utils``.
- conda-package ``meta.yaml`` generation with a template.
- Support for non-pure Python package releases with ``cibuildwheel``.
- Support for headless GitHub CI testing for GUI applications.
- Reusable GitHub Actions workflows located in `Billingegroup/release-scripts <https://github.com/Billingegroup/release-scripts/tree/main/.github/workflows>`_.
